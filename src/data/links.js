I strongly gravitate towards designing and developing applications that have a notable impact on large amounts of people and solve real problems. I also love educating others. I have an entrepreneurial spirit and enjoy leadership positions which I fully embrace on a daily basis running and growing HiOctave, a web design and digital marketing agency. HiOctave allows me to explore my creativity in the areas of UI design, photography, and videography, which in turn has immensely enhanced my creativity as both a programmer and a person.",
