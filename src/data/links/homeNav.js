    textMain: "A full-stack developer with mechanical engineering and entrepreneurial exprience currently seeking a full-time development opportunity. I strongly gravitate towards designing and developing applications that have a notable impact on large amounts of people, solve real problems, and have one-of-a-kind user experiences. I also love educating others. I have an entrepreneurial spirit and enjoy leadership positions which I fully embrace on a daily basis running and growing HiOctave, a web design and digital marketing agency. HiOctave allows me to explore my creativity in the areas of front-end development, UI design, photography, and videography, which in turn has immensely enhanced my creativity as both a programmer and a person.",
